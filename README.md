# Face-Recognition-Attendance-System
This project is based on the technology of Computer Vision in AI, it marking attendance from detecting faces of person. It detects the face of person in real time using webcam. The Computer Vision techniques we use in this project is image analysis, face detection, face-recognition. This Model is checks that captured image attendance is marked or not and take the decision based on the data which it will be get, processed it and give the output. If the attendance of that capture image is not marked then model mark it. If the attendance of that captured image is already marked then the model shows attendance already marked of that captured person image. So, we can proceed it to the next one and same process is repeated for the every person.
